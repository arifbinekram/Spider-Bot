# Spider-Bot

Spider-Bot is a web crawler designed to collect and process URLs from a given website. It scans the provided URL, collects all hyperlinks on the page, follows these links, and extracts further URLs. This project can be useful for web scraping, data collection, and analysis purposes.

## Features

- Collects and processes URLs from a given website.
- Extracts hyperlinks recursively from the pages it visits.
- Handles HTTP requests with user-agent headers to avoid 403 Forbidden errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `beautifulsoup4` package

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arifbinekram/Spider-Bot.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Spider-Bot
    ```

3. Install the required package:
    ```sh
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with the target URL as a command-line argument:

```sh
python3 spider.py <target_url>
```

For example:

```sh
python3 spider.py https://www.example.com
```

## How It Works

1. The script takes a target URL as an argument.
2. It sends an HTTP request to the target URL with a user-agent header to mimic a web browser.
3. It parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup and collects all hyperlinks (`<a>` tags).
4. It follows the collected hyperlinks and repeats the process, gathering more URLs.
5. The collected URLs are printed to the console.
